# eco-route-finder

Creating an eco-route finder application in Python involves integrating several data sources like traffic and environmental data to calculate eco-friendly routes. This guide will outline a basic version of such an application, leveraging libraries like `requests` for API calls and `networkx` for route calculations. We'll use mock data sources to simulate real-time inputs, but in a live application, you'd connect to real APIs. 

Here's a simplified Python program:

```python
import requests
import networkx as nx

def get_traffic_data():
    """
    Simulate getting traffic data from an API.
    Returns a dictionary with traffic information.
    """
    # In a real-world scenario, you would use requests.get() to fetch data.
    try:
        # Simulate an API response with traffic data
        traffic_data = {
            ('A', 'B'): {'traffic_level': 2},  # 1 - light, 2 - moderate, 3 - heavy
            ('B', 'C'): {'traffic_level': 1},
            ('C', 'D'): {'traffic_level': 3},
            ('D', 'A'): {'traffic_level': 1},
        }
        return traffic_data
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error fetching traffic data: {e}")
        return None

def get_environmental_data():
    """
    Simulate getting environmental data from an API.
    Returns a dictionary with environmental information.
    """
    # In a real-world scenario, you would use requests.get() to fetch data.
    try:
        # Simulate an API response with environmental impact data
        environmental_data = {
            ('A', 'B'): {'emissions': 5},  # Lower numbers are more eco-friendly
            ('B', 'C'): {'emissions': 3},
            ('C', 'D'): {'emissions': 8},
            ('D', 'A'): {'emissions': 2},
        }
        return environmental_data
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error fetching environmental data: {e}")
        return None

def build_graph(traffic_data, environmental_data):
    """
    Build a graph with traffic and environmental data as edge attributes.
    """
    G = nx.DiGraph()
    
    for edge, traffic_info in traffic_data.items():
        environmental_info = environmental_data.get(edge, {'emissions': 0})
        weight = traffic_info['traffic_level'] * environmental_info['emissions']
        G.add_edge(edge[0], edge[1], weight=weight)
    
    return G

def find_eco_friendly_route(G, start, end):
    """
    Find the most eco-friendly route using Dijkstra's algorithm.
    """
    try:
        path = nx.dijkstra_path(G, source=start, target=end, weight='weight')
        return path
    except nx.NetworkXNoPath:
        print("No path found.")
        return []
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error finding route: {e}")
        return []

def main():
    # Fetch real-time data
    traffic_data = get_traffic_data()
    environmental_data = get_environmental_data()

    if not traffic_data or not environmental_data:
        print("Failed to retrieve necessary data.")
        return

    # Build the graph
    G = build_graph(traffic_data, environmental_data)

    # Get user input for start and end locations
    start = 'A'  # For the sake of this example, we hard code the start point
    end = 'D'    # and the end point - in practice, obtain these from user input.

    # Find and display the eco-friendly route
    route = find_eco_friendly_route(G, start, end)
    if route:
        print(f"The eco-friendly route from {start} to {end} is: {' -> '.join(route)}")
    else:
        print("No eco-friendly route found.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Key Components:
- **Data Simulation**: Instead of real API calls, the program uses simulated traffic and environmental data.
- **Network Construction**: `networkx` is used to create a directed graph, where edges have weights based on a combination of traffic congestion and emissions data.
- **Route Calculation**: The eco-friendly route is determined using Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm, considering both traffic and environmental data.
- **Error Handling**: Basic error handling is included to manage failed data fetches and route calculations.

### Usage:
- Replace simulated data with actual API calls to sources like Google Maps or a traffic data provider.
- Expand graph and data handling to accommodate real-world complexities (e.g., dynamic data refresh, various transport modes).

This code provides a structure for developing a more comprehensive app integrated with real-time data sources.
